 ## What do I bring to launchcode (and you)?
  * Architecture at scale - proudest thing on my current resume is scaling LoL to tens of millions of concurrent Chinese players.
  * Cutting-edge microservice development - almost nothing but AWS (Java) development since 2014.
  * Interviewing - have participated in more than 2,000 technical interviewers throughout my career; only 2 disastorous hires during that time!
  * Love of teaching - seeing enthusiastic people learn about coding brings me a *ton* of personal fulfillment.
  
## What do I believe?
 * It's not how smart you are, it's how hard you work.  Anyone can write good software.
     * Getting frustrated means you're learning; ["experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted"](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Randy_Pausch), and I have a *ton* of experience.
 * I have an obligation to help you learn better, you have an obligation to help me teach better
     * Visual learners, you're in luck!  Other learners, call me out!
     * I *hate* when things look easy for the instructor!
     * I *hate* questions/problems that are designed to be failed!
     * I *love* questions with no single right or wrong answer
     * I *love* professional technical debate
 * Startup mentality; if you're not writing code that solves a business problem, you're not doing anything useful or important.
 * Total ownership; you own a *product* that contains code.  The product is (almost) never "just code".
 * Always getting better
     * Requires honesty, vulnerability, and EQ
     * Walk the talk - every lecture is retroed by *all* of us!
