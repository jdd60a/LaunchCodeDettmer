# LaunchCodeDettmer
Everything you need to know about John Dettmer at LaunchCode

## Who am I?
 * Graduated MU in 2004, BS in CS
 * Worked in 5 industries since then - [Shelter](https://www.shelterinsurance.com/), [Cerner](https://www.cerner.com/), [Overstock](https://www.overstock.com/), [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/), and [Victorious Inc.](http://victorious.com/) - in different roles.
  * 1 wife, 2 kids, 3 pets
  * 2012 mustang GT mid-life crisis car of choice
  * killab227 on steam; playing a lot of PUBG right now
  * *Terrible* with names and faces; it's not personal!!
 
 ## What do I bring to launchcode (and you)?
  * Architecture at scale - proudest thing on my current resume is scaling LoL to tens of millions of concurrent Chinese players.
  * Cutting-edge microservice development - almost nothing but AWS (Java) development since 2014.
  * Interviewing - have participated in more than 2,000 technical interviewers throughout my career; only 2 disastorous hires during that time!
  * Love of teaching - seeing enthusiastic people learn about coding brings me a *ton* of personal fulfillment.
  
## What do I believe?
 * It's not how smart you are, it's how hard you work.  Anyone can write good software.
     * Getting frustrated means you're learning; ["experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted"](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Randy_Pausch), and I have a *ton* of experience.
 * I have an obligation to help you learn better, you have an obligation to help me teach better
     * Visual learners, you're in luck!  Other learners, call me out!
     * I *hate* when things look easy for the instructor!
     * I *hate* questions/problems that are designed to be failed!
     * I *love* questions with no single right or wrong answer
     * I *love* professional technical debate
 * Startup mentality; if you're not writing code that solves a business problem, you're not doing anything useful or important.
 * Total ownership; you own a *product* that contains code.  The product is (almost) never "just code".
 * Always getting better
     * Requires honesty, vulnerability, and EQ
     * Walk the talk - every lecture is retroed by *all* of us!
  
  ## Resources
   * [Effective Java](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch-ebook/dp/B00B8V09HY/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=), which is a great overview of Java for any experience level.

  ## Classes
  ### Wednesday 11/1/2017 - [A New Hope](http://www.asciimation.co.nz/)
  #### Ciriculum
   * Congrats on making it through the first two courses!  You've come a long way!
   * About me; hard work, information radiator, comedian in a former life.  Will show you "enterprise" Java backend development.
   * Invest time in the prep & studio work!  It will make the assigments much easier!
   * Overall goal; make you all an "enterprise hire"; means a lot of learning
      * Test-Driven-Development & unit testing
      * "Startup mindset"
      * Devops, full-stack, and other buzzwords
      * Collaborating with other engineers
      * Gradle, and other professional build tools/best practices
  * I don't know everything; please question me! Use me as a foil to feel out professional technical debate
  * We're going to retro every class; want to get everybody into an [agile mindset](http://agilemanifesto.org).  This requires participation and candor to work!
  * The JDK; what is it?  Garbage collection, memory management, and heap
      * Hot spot compilation makes Java just as efficient as a native app in all JDK-compatible environments.
      * Memory management is not foolproof; it's very easy to leak memory in Java, just maintain a reference to the memory that prevents it from being cleaned up!
      * Refernces; why can I have an NPE in Java if I don't have to care about pointers?
      * Data types; primitives, Obects, and making sure money is a `long` so you can't Superman III
      * `java.lang.String` is special because it's an immutble class.
      * Math - we won't get past algebra in this class, but note how multiply by null is almost as bad as [divide by zero](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/17324/airplane-software-crash-caused-by-zero-negative-altitude-at-dead-sea)
